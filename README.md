# advent-of-code-2021

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [moosolutions][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, me is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

This is my first year trying to solve the puzzles. I use Advent of Code to learn Kotlin, which is probably why most of the solutions I implemented were too complicated, but that's exactly why I'm taking part in order to get better.

If you stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:

- [Kotlin docs][docs]
- [Kotlin Slack][slack]
- Template [issue tracker][issues]


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
